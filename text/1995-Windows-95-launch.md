### 1. notes
2 weeks after Netscape IPO. Possibly the largest product launch in history. Stores open at midnight, Jennifer Annistor and Matthew Perry show of the features.  Empire State Building is lit in Windows colors. Rolling Stones got 14mil to use Start me Up in commercials. Plenty of people experienced internet via Win95.
