### 1. notes
* even though the concept of hypervisor goes back to the late 1960s, it's in the early 2000s that we see the resurgence of virtualization because of
    * expanding hardware capabilities, allowing each single machine to do more simultaneous work
    * efforts to control costs and to simplify management through consolidation of servers
    * the need to control large multiprocessor and cluster installations, for example in server farms and render farms
    * the improved security, reliability and device independence possible from hypervisor architectures
    * the ability to run complex, OS-dependent applications in different hardware or OS environments
