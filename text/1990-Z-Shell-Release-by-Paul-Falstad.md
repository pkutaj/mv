### 1. notes
* The Z shell (zsh) can be used interactively as a login shell or as more sophisticated command interpreter for shell scripting. As with previous shells, it is an optimized Bourne shell that incorporates several features from bash and tcsh and is mostly backwards compatible. Zsh comes with the tabbed auto-completion, regex integration (in addition to the standard glowing options available since the 1970s, additional shorthand for command scoping, but with a number of security features. The ability to limit memory and privilege escalations became critical in order to keep from having some of the same issues we‚Äôve seen for decades with Windows and other operating systems as they evolved to meet Unix scripting, borrowing many a feature for Powershell from cousins in the Unix and Linux worlds.
