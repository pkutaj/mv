### 1. notes
* not TCP/IP protocol: Internetwork Packet Exchange, or IPX, and Sequenced Packet Exchange, or SPX, creating standards that would become common in most businesses in the subsequent decades. 
* They joined Novell in 1983 and Major later became Chief Scientist. 
* The 1980s were good to Novell. 
* They released Netware 2 in 1986, becoming independent of the hardware and more modular. Servers could be connected through ARCNET, Ethernet, and Token Ring. 
* They added fault tolerance options to remap bad blocks, added RAID support, and used a key card inserted in the ISA bus to license the software. 
* And they immediately started working on Netware 3, which wouldn‚Äôt be complete until 1990, with 3.11 setting the standard in network file sharing and when I first worked with Netware. 
* Netware 3 was easier to install. 
	- It was 32-bit, allowed volumes up to a terabyte, and I remember this being cool at the time, you could add volume segments on the fly while the volume was mounted. 
	- Although growing the volume was always‚Ä¶ in need of checking backups first. 
	- They didn‚Äôt worry a lot about the GUI. 
* Dealers didn‚Äôt mind that. 
* HP, DEC, and Data General all licensed OEM versions of the software. 
* This was also my first experience with clustering, as NetWare SFT-III allowed a mirror an a different machine. 
* All of this led to patents and the founding of new concepts that would, whether intentionally or accidentally, be copied by other vendors over the coming years. 
* They grew, they sold hardware, like otherwise expensive ethernet cards, at cost to grab market share, and they had a lot of dealers who were loyal, in part due to great margins they had been earning but also because Netware wasn‚Äôt simple to run and so required support contracts with those dealers. 
* By 1990, most businesses used Novell if they needed to network computers. 
* And NetWare 3.x seemed to cement that. They worked with larger and larger customers, becoming the Enterprise standard. 
* Once upon a time, no one ever got fired for buying Netware. 
* But Microsoft had been growing into the powerhouse standard of the day
