### 1. notes
IX and Ultrix and their underlying hardware were different enough that our code was a mess of IF AIX and IF ULTRIX statements. Sometimes we had to write separate AIX and Ultrix versions of entire subroutines and functions. We had to compile the code twice, once on AIX and once on Ultrix! Java was a total game changer when it came out in 1995. You mean we can write one codebase with no OS- or hardware-dependent IFs and no separate routines, and run it on any machine that can run the JVM? Voodoo!
