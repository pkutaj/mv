### 1. notes
* The typewriter came in 1874, as parts kept getting smaller and people kept tinkerating with ideas to automate all the things. 
* Herman Hollerith filed for a patent in 1884 to use a machine to punch and count punched cars. 
* He used that first in health care management and then in the 1890 census. 
* He later formed Tabulating Machine Company, in 1896. 
* In the meantime, Julius E. Pitrap patented a computing scale in 1885. 
* William S Burroughs (not that one, the other one) formed the American Arithmometer Company in 1886. 
* Sales exploded for these and they merged, creating the Computing-Tabulation-Recording Company. 
* Thomas J Watson, Sr joined the company as president in 1914 and expanded business, especially outside of the United States. 
* The name of the company was changed to International Business Machines, or IBM for short, in 1924.
