### 1. notes
* implemented fully in 1967
* ASCII was initially published in 1963 so computers could exchange information in a standardized fashion. 
* Single most important computer standard 
* Bell Labs was involved and so it’s no surprise we saw ASCII show up within just a couple of years on the Teletype.
> When screens dropped in price enough, and Unix came along in 1971, also from the Bell system, it’s no surprised that the first shells were referred to as TTY, short for teletype
