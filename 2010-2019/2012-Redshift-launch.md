### 1. notes
* Redshift is a data warehouse (aka OLAP database) offered by AWS
* Before Redshift, it was the dark ages
* The main player was Teradata, which had an on-prem offering
* Startups said no to SQL and used Hadoop
* SQL was kind of lame back then, for reasons that in hindsight appear absurd
* One vendor was a company called ParAccel. 
* AWS licensed their technology, rebranded it Redshift, and launched in 2012.
