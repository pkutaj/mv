### 1. notes
"The UTF-8 encoding was invented in 1992 and standardized by January 1993. UTF-8 was adopted by the unix world over the following years due to its backwards-compatibility with its existing interfaces. Programs could read and write Unicode data, access Unicode paths, pass Unicode arguments, and get and set Unicode environment variables without needing to change anything. Today UTF-8 has become the dominant text encoding format in the world, in large part due to the world wide web.

In July 1993, Microsoft introduced the wide Windows API with the release of Windows NT 3.1, placing all their bets on UCS-2 (later UTF-16) rather than UTF-8. This turned out to be a mistake, since UTF-16 is inferior to UTF-8 in practically every way, though admittedly some problems weren‚Äôt so obvious at the time."
