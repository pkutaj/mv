### 1. notes
There’s a lot to unpack about what compilers brought to computing. For starters, they opened up programming to people that would otherwise have seen a bunch of mathematical notations and run away. In her words:  “I could say "Subtract income tax from pay" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.” This opened the field up to the next generation of programmers. It also had a second consequence: the computer was no longer just there to do math. Because the Mark I had been based on the Analytical Engine, it was considered a huge and amazing calculator.  But putting actual English words out there and then compiling (you can’t really call it converting because that’s an oversimplification) those into machine code meant the blinders started to come off and that next generation of programmers started to think of computers as… more.
