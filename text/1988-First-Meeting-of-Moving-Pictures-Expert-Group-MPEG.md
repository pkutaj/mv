### 1. notes
* MPEG is short for the Moving Picture Experts Group. 
* MPEG is a working group formed specifically to set standards for audio and video compression and the transmission of that audio and video over networks. 
* The first meeting of the group was in 1988. 
* The group defined a standard format for playing media on the Internet, soon to actually be a thing (but not yet). 
* And thus the MPEG format was born. 
* MPEG is now the international standard for encoding and compressing video images. 
* Following the first release they moved quickly. 
* In 1992, the MPEG-1 standard was approved at a meeting in London. 
* This gave us MPEG Layer 3, or MP3 as well as video CDs.  
* At the Porto meeting in 1994, we got MPEG-2 standard, thus DVDs, DVD players and AAC standard a long standard for iTunes and used for both television and audio encoding. 
* MPEG-4 came in 1999, and the changes began to slow as adoption increased. 
* Today, MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 are under development.
